This little project grew from an Intro to Scripting class where we had to create a simple text game as a final project using Python. 
Although I was new to Python, I had been messing around with scripting for a little bit and wanted something more complex. That's how my classmate and I took the idea of a text RPG and created this little game.
Along the way, we had to learn how to work on the same project using GitHub and overcome some challenges such as:

  1. My original idea needed a timer to limit the time for game completion. That was a story-driven decision, which required the use of threads.
  2. The whole game is happening in a plain console, so the rendering requires reprinting everything every time something happens.
     That became even more challenging when my partner insisted on dynamic typing of messages, which looks cool but adds an extra layer of complexity.
  3. Complex logic with multiple conditions for movement and interactions.
